A. Tasks accomplished
- The group found a project adviser and a panelist for this subject and they will be working on the project immediately after consultation.

B. Problems encountered
- So far, two panelists is the problem while the project itself is still a continuous work in finding errors and improvement. The printing place of the documents to be submitted to the adviser and the panelist is still not available but would soon open.

C. Possible solutions
- Think of the two panelists for the project and to find errors before the project is to be implemented.Print the documents ahead of time so that it will be ready for submission.

D. Next steps to accomplish
- Immediately find the two panelists and make sure that the error or any improvement of some sort will be accomplished in order to make the project smooth and error-free before it is used.Fix the errors or the table arrangement of the system.
