Meeting Minutes:

1. Topics Discussed:

- The group created the views of their ERD tables that will help them in analyzing their work even more. The three main tables namely Baptismal, Confirmation and Marriage already have a view of the Godparent table that the client already requested.

2. Items Agreed Upon

- The group still agrees in dividing the work and task for the project like assigning the tables for each of us. Baptismal for Gene Kadano, Confirmation for Mark Andes and Emmanuel Tero for Marriage.

3. Items to be clarified

- The group is still clarifying their individual work like getting the views done per table and how it could combine their work that could make the system work in harmony.

4. Next Things to Do

-  Pull, Commit and Push is still needed for the project and so far the group is still very careful regarding this matter as they do individual work with the assigned tables.

5. Conclusion

- The group will be working on the project and the views and ajax codes as soon as possible as the presentation for Iteration 1 is approaching very fast.
